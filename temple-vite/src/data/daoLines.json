  "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao",
  "The name that can be named is not the eternal name",
  "The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth",
  "The named is the mother of ten thousand things",
  "Ever desireless, one can see the mystery",
  "Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations",
  "These two spring from the same source but differ in name",
  "This appears as darkness",
  "Darkness within darkness",
  "The gate to all mystery"
